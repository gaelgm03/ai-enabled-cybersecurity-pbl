# AI-Enabled Cybersecurity (PBL)

## MIT Blended AI+X Program  
**Project-Based Learning: AI in Cybersecurity – Anthropic Project**  
**Track 3: AI-Enabled Cybersecurity**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the work for the **AI in Cybersecurity Project-Based Learning (PBL)** as part of the **MIT Blended AI+X Program**.

The project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be used to **assist defensive cybersecurity tasks**, such as identifying software vulnerabilities, supporting security audits, and automating parts of penetration testing workflows—while carefully considering the **risks, limitations, and ethical concerns** introduced by AI systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand how LLMs introduce **new security risks and attack surfaces**
- Explore how AI can support **defensive cybersecurity workflows**
- Identify common **software vulnerabilities** and how AI may assist in detecting or explaining them
- Design and prototype a **lightweight AI-assisted cybersecurity tool**
- Apply **responsible AI principles**, including human-in-the-loop validation

## 📅 Week 1 Focus

**Week 1 Objectives (Track 3):**
- Gain familiarity with **Git** and collaborative workflows
- Build foundational understanding of **software vulnerabilities**
- Frame vulnerabilities in the context of **AI-assisted security analysis**

**Week 1 Progress:**
- Repository setup and team collaboration established  
- Core Git workflows practiced (branching, commits, pull requests)  
- Review of common vulnerability types (e.g., injection, access control, misconfiguration)  
- Initial discussion on how LLMs can assist or introduce risks in cybersecurity

## ⚠️ Ethical & Security Considerations

This project is conducted strictly for **educational and defensive purposes**.  
All experiments and tools developed will:
- Avoid unauthorized or unethical security testing
- Respect data privacy and confidentiality
- Include human oversight for AI-generated outputs
- Align with responsible AI and cybersecurity best practices

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Narrow the initial vulnerability scope
- Design the AI-assisted security workflow
- Begin prototyping and evaluation of LLM outputs
- Define success metrics and limitations
