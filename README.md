# AI-Enabled Cybersecurity (PBL)

## MIT Blended AI+X Program  
**Project-Based Learning: AI in Cybersecurity – Anthropic Project**  
**Track 3: AI-Enabled Cybersecurity**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the work for the **AI in Cybersecurity Project-Based Learning (PBL)** as part of the **MIT Blended AI+X Program**.

The project explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be used to **assist defensive cybersecurity tasks**, such as identifying software vulnerabilities, supporting security audits, and automating parts of penetration testing workflows—while carefully considering the **risks, limitations, and ethical concerns** introduced by AI systems.
