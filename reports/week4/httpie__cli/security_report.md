## Detailed Findings

### 🔐 Exposed Secrets & Credentials

*Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data found in source code.*

#### 1. Potential Password/Secret

**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH  
**Detector:** `regex-patterns`

**Evidence:**

- **File:** `httpie\ssl_.py:32`
- **Match (redacted):** `Opti*****str]`

**Intent:**

The code appears to store a Password/Secret for authentication or API access. This is likely used to connect to an external service.

**Attack Surface:**

- **Entry Point:** Anyone with access to the source code repository

- **Likelihood:** High - Secrets in code are easily discovered

**Recommended Fix:**

1. **Remove** the hardcoded secret from the source code
2. **Rotate** the exposed credential immediately
3. **Use** environment variables or a secrets manager
4. **Audit** version control history for the exposed value

**Verification:**

- Re-run the security scanner to confirm removal
- Verify the old credential no longer provides access
- Check git history was cleaned if necessary

## General Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Rotate all exposed secrets** - Assume they are compromised

### Preventive Measures

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Use gitleaks or similar to prevent secret commits
- **CI/CD scanning**: Integrate security scanning into the build pipeline
- **Dependency monitoring**: Use Dependabot or Snyk for continuous monitoring
- **Code review**: Include security review in the PR process
- **Developer training**: Educate team on secure coding practices

## About This Report

This security report was generated by the **AI-Enabled Cybersecurity Scanner** developed as part of the MIT Blended AI+X Program (Track 3).

### Limitations

- This is a **static analysis** tool and may produce false positives
- Not all vulnerabilities can be detected through pattern matching
- Human review is essential for accurate risk assessment
- This tool does **not** exploit or test vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If this scan revealed potential vulnerabilities in third-party software:

1. Do **NOT** publicly disclose specific vulnerability details
2. Contact the maintainers privately through their security policy
3. Allow reasonable time for patches before any disclosure
4. Follow the project's responsible disclosure guidelines
